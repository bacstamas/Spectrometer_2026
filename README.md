## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains the complete hardware and software implementation of a low-cost DIY spectrometer. The project is developed as part of my **Master’s Thesis in Computational Physics at UBB**.

The spectrometer is built using an Arduino-based acquisition system, a multispectral sensor, custom electronics, and 3D-printed mechanical parts, with a Java-based desktop application for data visualization and analysis.
