## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains the complete hardware and software implementation of a low-cost DIY spectrometer. The project is developed as part of my **Master’s Thesis in Computational Physics at UBB**.

The spectrometer is built using an Arduino-based acquisition system, a multispectral sensor, custom electronics, and 3D-printed mechanical parts, with a Java-based desktop application for data visualization and analysis.

## 🔧 Required Hardware Components
To build the spectrometer, you need the following components:

### 🧠 Electronics
- **Arduino Uno** – microcontroller for sensor control and data acquisition
- **SparkFun AS7265x Spectral Sensor** – multispectral sensor (visible)
- **BD139 NPN Transistor** – used for driving the light source
- **Light bulb with socket** – approx. **0.2 A at 5 V** (used as broadband illumination source)

### 🖨️ Mechanical Parts
- **3D printed enclosure**  
  (All CAD designs and STL files are included in the `3DModels/` directory.)
- **Spectrophotometer cuvettes**

## 🚀 How to Use
1. **Hardware Assembly**
   - Print the 3D models from the `3DModels/STL` folder.
   - Assemble the optical and electronic components according to the circuit diagram.

2. **Arduino Firmware**
   - Open the Arduino project in the `Arduino/` folder.
   - Upload the firmware to the Arduino Uno.

3. **Java Application**
   - Compile and run the Java GUI from the `Java/` folder.
   - The application reads spectral data from the Arduino and visualizes it.
